# This file assumes you are running toches locally, but with S3 and Redis
# from the docker-compose.

# If you are running toches in a container, you will need to change FK_API to eg.
# FK_API=http://toches:8080
FK_API=http://localhost:8080

# Downstream services use an internal API key to authenticate
# against our back-end service. In production this comes from
# a Kubernetes secret, in development "1234" is used.
